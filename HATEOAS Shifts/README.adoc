### HATEOAS Shifts

* The 'HATEOAS Shifts' section is to demonstrate the HATEOAS/ReactJS frontend elements of the assignment, I have implemented authentication using Spring Security.
The credentials are:

```
 university/fielding.
```
To install type:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```


* At the moment the passwords stored in the application.properties file are not encrypted. This means that if for any reason any attacker gained access to the application.properties file, the username and password would be on show to anybody in plaintext.
* This can easily be prevented with the use of encryption, however you need to choose the correct type of encryption.
* For use in passwords, you actually need to store the hash value of a password, and not encrypt it. This is because encrypting implies that it can be decrypted, but we just want a one way hash value for something to be compared with.
* Using salted MD5 and SHA for passwords is a bad idea. Not because of MD5's cryptographic weaknesses, but because it's fast. This means that an attacker can try billions of candidate passwords per second on a single GPU.
* You should use are deliberately slow hash constructions, such as scrypt, bcrypt and PBKDF2.
* By using a hash of a password, we can compare entries for two passwords. On the server side we simply compare the value entered from the client to the value stored in the database, if they match, the password has been correctly entered and the user should be allowed to log in.
* A random salt should be automatically generated. This protects against rainbow attacks which are a list of pre-generated hash values of common passwords. A randomly generated salt will ensure even the same password will have a different hash value.
